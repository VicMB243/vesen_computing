#The database uses windows default username(root) and empty password ("")

#The first page to be loaded is the index
#Then you'll be taken to the login screen for users authentication
#From there you can register as a new user or fill in the form
#After verification you'll be taken to the dasboard where a list of existing accounts  is displayed
#Depending on your admin rights You can add a new user and authomatically update the dashboard's table
#or update/delete existing users depending on your rights as an addmin
#By default each user has the default right to add a new one
#But other rights such as edit/delete are assigned by competent admins having the right to do so

#For purpose of testing Each user can edit his/her own account no matter the rights he has 
#in order to give himself other rights (edit and delete) to be tested but in real life scenario this feature #should  be reviewed, only a competent admin should be able to edit a record no matter who's the owner of that account
