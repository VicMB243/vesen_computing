# vensen_computing test 

#The database is local and uses windows default username(root) and empty password ("")

#The first page to be loaded is the index
#Then you'll be taken to the login screen for user authentication
#From there you can register as a new user or fill in the form and login if already registered
#After verification you'll be taken to the landing page (dashboard)where a list of existing admins is displayed
#Depending on your admin rights You can add a new user and authomatically update the dashboard's table
#or update/delete existing admins depending on your rights

#For purpose of testing each new user has the default right to add a new admin 
#meaning he can add his/her own account as an admin no matter the rights he has and give himself other #privileges (add, edit and delete other accounts)  this is just for testing reasons...
#but in real life scenario this feature should  be reviewed, only a predefined admin should be able to perform that operation
